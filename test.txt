41. I love this cell phone mount! I researched the heck out of the various mounts and decided to go with the iottie 4. I absolutely love how it works, how heavy duty it is and how i don’t need to monkey around much to get my phone attached. I had one problem with the gel pad and sent a request to the company via their FB page as they do not have them available on Amazon or anywhere else I could find. The customer service person answered my message immediately and gave me a link to file a claim for a replacement. Within a week I had a new iottie and excellent follow-up by the other customer service rep. I am so happy with my choice.
42. I put it on the dash. Several days later I decided to move it over a few inches. Wow I had to use a paint scraper to remove it. It doesn't move after you have put it down. What a great product.
43. I have had a few of these devices for holding my phone. I used an iphone 8 plus and previous devices didn't manuever as well in my car ( Versa) windshield and dash, so the others would make my phone tip over or shift. I can honestly say that this will hold a larger smartphone well.
44. I write very few reviews but read a lot to help select a product. However this product deserves a positive review. I bought it just before leaving AZ on my summer travels in June. I was careful to read what had NOT worked for others, mainly mounting issues. I thoroughly cleaned the area on my dash with rubbing alcohol where I was using the mounting plate. Bottom line --- mounting plate never moved in temperature ranges from 110 F to 40 F. Also the suction to the plate is still holding from the day I mounted it. The road trip was over 7900 miles in 9 weeks over many forest service & backcountry roads in my FJ Toyota.
45. Great product. Ideal for ride-share drivers or people that travel and use their phones for GPS all the time. The spring-grab-and-release works better then I expected. It is just place on the window and forget. I have used many of these and they all end up breaking, This one looks better built (almost over-engineered) and has endless ways to turn and the ball at the end where the phone is so you all ways get the best view, no limits. Takes bumps and shock movements without jilting the phone that broke many of my other cheap ones.
46. This is exactly what I was looking for to hold my phone while I drive. It was easy to set up and install, and it's a sturdy product. I have an IPhone 8 that is stored in an OtterBox case, where it's held by the iOttie just fine. It is nice to no longer have my phone set in random places while I drive. I am especially happy that I can use this when I have my map navigation activated, so I can have the directions displayed in front of me. This product will not let you down!
47. Love this thing. Fits my iphone 7s with an otter case. True, it just barely fits, but that's good enough! I've got a Prius and it's stuck on the dash it works perfectly there, holds the phone within easy sight distance, and has an opening for the charger cord. I am happy with the ergonomics and with this purchase. Highly recommended.
48. Yes it's more expensive than the sub$10 phone holders, but it's well worth it. It's much more stable and holds my phone (iphone 8) more securely. I bought one of the $10 holders thinking it would be "good enough" and it was okay, but broke within three months of regular handling.
49. I drive a RAM 1500 and I love this cell phone cradle. I have been using it for months now and have had no issues. The phone stays in the cradle and is right at my fingertips do to the articulating arm. It was an easy install on the dash using the supplied dash pad.
50. LOVE THESE!! So functional with ease of reach without the need to over extend. Smooth movement standing, leaning, tilting or turned to the side. This works perfectly, bought 2 more!!
41. Detached from dashboard after about a month. Cannot attach again. Poor quality. Sign remained on the dashboard.
42. It doesn’t stick at all! I peeled off the film to place it on my dashboard and it doesn’t hold whatsoever, raised the lever and flipped it back down and then tried to rinse it as directed. POJ!
43. wouldn't stay attached to the dashboard. Followed instructions.
44. Bought this an within 2 months the glue for the base to go on my dash was coming apart. Waste of money!!!!
45. I was super happy iOttie cellphone holder. And I bought the second one. One of the holders fell off from the car dashboard. I recommended this product to couple of our family members and I am not sure how their car cellphone holder is.
46. I followed the instructions and placed it on my dash. As I started to drive it fell off my dash. Had I not caught it my phone would have had the screen broken on the gear shift. The adhesive they use is worthless.
47. It worked for a while until it started getting hot then the sticky stopped holding .
48. Bought this after all the great reviews, and it disappointed. I use a Rangerover Evoque and trying to use this on the dashboard it doesn't stay. Tried it on multiple places and no luck.
49. I bought this phone mount holder about a month ago based on the good reviews. Unfortunately, the mount came off the car and I was no longer able to keep my phone mounted. Disappointed.
50. In less than 1 month, it no longer sticks.We followed the instructions -ran warm water over it and let it air dry- and that didn't work. Amazon return policy expired yesterday. Waste of money!
