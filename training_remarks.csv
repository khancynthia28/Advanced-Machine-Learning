This is totally worth the  bucks You can transfer it between vehicles and for most dashes will stick right on The mount is not shaky creepy or short of features It held my iPhone X with case and before that it held my iPhone s Plus I use this for long distance travel and commuting and t is perfect The mount makes it very easy to load and unload your phone and change the orientation This new model looks best out of all of them You can see in my pictures this new version set side by side with the last model The functionality is the same but I believe it is way more pleasing to the eye:1
I didnt want a magnet and searched for a while to find the right dashboard mount Everyone who gets in my car mentions it It is sturdy and easy to use with one hand I have small hands I like that I can put anyones phone in the mount so if something else directions I can just pop their phone in so I can see it It swivels and sits nicely I have it on backwards and stretched out because I have trex arms I didnt use the sticky thing that came for dashboard mounting It is on my dashboard but just using the suction cup as if it were on the window It is awesome and my sister and daughter want to order one as well:1
This is my third gen iOttie device  and they just keep getting better My only gripe not worth a deduction is that in my current car the weight of my iphone  plus hanging at an incredibly low angle kept tearing the stick disk off the dash  something I had never experienced in other configurations with less weight at that angle So I glued the disk to the dash thanks Shoe Goo and no more issues This is one of those simple devices that is extremely configurable It can be flipped over extended and there are joints and handturn adjustments that can support some pretty wild configurations It easily holds my iPhone s with its large case and snapping the phone in or out is simple:1
Absolutely love this phone car mount Incredibly secure hold not only on the dashboard but with my phone I like that it has an opening at the bottom so that I can run my USB charging cord to the phone when my phone is mounted I tried the vent one but the mount wouldnt stay in the vent The CD kind was not an option This is my third iOttie I have one of the earliest ones and a newer one that extends For this vehicle I wanted one that would extend and then be able to drop below  degrees so that the phone hangs a big below my dash This ones ability to pivot  degrees made all the difference I can keep it in eyesight without it taking up too much of my vision out:1
iOttie has excellent customer service I contacted them about my disappointment that my first one would not remain mounted they promptly sent me a new iOttie Easy One Touch  They look identical but the new one worked flawlessly I took it out of box placed the new one on my windshield and it has stayed mounted for a full week now with no issues I’m so happy this second one operates correctly because I like the design of product and really wanted it to work for me:1
Im starting to like this one way better than my CD phone holder Its so simple to use I love that I dont have to fiddle with it to squeeze the phone All you do is press it against the back and it locks shut Super easy And the suction has been sticking without any problem even when I drive on bouncy fire roads I would strongly recommend this phone holder I may end up replacing my CD one with this one:1
Dont bother with those crappy vent mounts Theyre all terrible and will probably just mess up your cars vents This product is vastly superior and a great price I bought two of these one for myself and my wife and we couldnt be happier Installation was a breeze and daily usage is also supremely easy You wont regret buying this universal car mount If you dont want to stick it to your dash you can use the window We both mounted ours on the dash never was a big fan of window mounts because of the blocking of the view but on the dash it works perfectly:1
I like the ability to adjust the phone in multiple directions:1
Ie had it for about a month now and it is a solid mount I keep my phone plugged in most of the time and the mount does not interfere with the cable I attached the sticky base to my dashboard Toyota Highlander I hope that when I dismount it wont damage the dashboard it should not for what I read:1
I had been using a cradle attached to the vent which pretty much made that vent unusable I like being able to use the dashboard vent especially now with low temps outside:1
Easy to install  took dashboard base stuck to dashboard and then just suction the unit to the pad It is very secure and adjustable It locks into place and I am confident it will not budge unless I remove it I have an iPhone plus sitting in it I really like the mechanism for insertingremoving Push  levers inwards to open push phone in to trigger the clamp down I really like this better than my prior mount which I had to use  hands to hold clamp apart and insert or remove Well worth the price and highly recommend My only concern would be around removing the base  if I leave for a year will it cause any kind of damage when removing According to the docs it will not:1
I bought this product because I recently bought my first car and frequently need to use the GPS on my phone but I didn’t have a place to put my phone where I could easily see it while driving I wanted something sleek that would look nice and match my car’s black and light beige interior while still being practical and inexpensive Based on the reviews for this product I purchased it It was easy to install I like how easy it is to put my phone on it I have an iPhone  with a semi clunky case and it fits perfectly I love that I can rotate and swivel the phone to point in all different directions and even switch to landscape mode It holds onto the phone well and the phone has never fallen out of it I like that there is room for a charger to stick out of it for when I’m charging while driving  that’s handy All in all I’m glad I bought this It’s the perfect home for my phone in the car and I would highly recommend it:1
Love it My Chevy Equinox doesnt have room for accessories and my iPhone  Plus just wont fit any where useful This iOttie mounted perfectly on the dash and is so adjustable my phone is exactly where it needs to be I was skeptical about the mounting disc since my dash isnt perfectly smooth but I was pleasantly surprised how well it sticks and holds the phone mount My iPhone  Plus is in an Otterbox Symmetry case and it fits great in the iOttie:1
This thing is the best I was a bit skeptical as to what it was so special about this one that sticks to the dashboard and the phone will not fall but alas since the day I put it there I has NEVER fallen nor move It also has many ways to position your phone whether you want it higher lower closer to you farther etc I love thehold of this thing you simply put your phone and it is almost as if it detects the phone and then BAM it gets a hold of it very security I must say Dont bother buying the other cheap stuff this one will do the job and it will never fail you:1
I really like this dashboard mount It was very easy to install It hasn’t moved at all since I installed it It is very versatile regarding cases on your phone My husband’s case is bulkier than mine iPhone  plus and it adjusts and works fine for him I put a pop socket in the back of my case and it doesn’t fit quite as it used to I have to align it just right for it to work but it still works fine I really like that you can turn it so that your phone is in landscape mode I also like that it can tilt up down and side to side It’s also nice that the bottom lightning port is exposed so I can plug in my charger if needed Overall it’s a great purchase:1
Ive had this for a couple weeks it has excellent stickability to the windshield highly customizable positioning with the adjustment points and its super easy to inserttake out your phone The ball and socket joint behind the cradle tightens and loosens easily and effectively to position the phone however you want The mount holds the phone in such a way that I can reach it much more easily than with my previous The suction cup has some sort of gel on it so that after sticking it once I actually havent been able to get it off the windshield without fear of breaking the mount Might be an issue for some but I think moistening it releases it easily Seems like the last car mount Ill ever need to buy:1
This is pretty cool I attached it to my windshield because i wasnt sure if i wanted to damage the leather in my car as per previous reviewers It holds really well I have an iphone s and its sturdy enough for it with a case You can adjust it however you want and it doesnt move or come off:1
This thing is fantastic I havent purchased a windshield mount for a phone in a while and boy have we made progress in the realm of suction cups I was expecting a typical plastic suction cup but this stuff is made out of some sort of goop infused with pixie dust The first time I stuck it to my windshield just to test fit the mount I went to remove it and it took me FIVE MINUTES of prying to get it off after which I had to take a break to allow me fingers to recover Oh and that was BEFORE I locked it into place using the lever to apply suction I cant imagine this thing will EVER fall off my windshield but it was also pretty cold in the garage so who knows how this stuff will act on a hot day The mount itself works very well Mine is partially extended so its actually cantilevered pretty far out but even in my lowered Subaru BRZ on coilovers it doesnt bounce or vibrate the way I was expecting Its a very solid mount The method of securing the phone to the mount by simply pressing it against the back button allowing the arms to snap into place is a great innovation and the release arms are easy to use as well No complaints here:1
I had the One Touch  which was still working flawlessly on my car but the small circular pad onto which you press the phone in order to snap the sides onto the phone was causing a small mark on some of my casesnot a big deal but I figured this new one along with the longer reach would be a nice upgrade and  for a product that I use everyday and makes my life that much easier seems to be a small price to pay The first unit I had for some reason would not stay stuck onto the pad accessory that comes with it which did not come with the One Touch  The unit kept sliding off of my dashboard  once with my  phone in it which I thankfully caught  which was not good I contacted iOttie which responded immediately and within three days I had a full replacement unit  not just the pad but a brand new entire unit which has worked flawlessly and is very secure on my  Honda Accord Hybrid I have it mounted backwards to get the maximum possible reach Using the ball joint to watch videos in landscape on my lunch break works very easily and still feels very secure Its a great product and an even better company I couldnt be happier with the upgrade:1
I torturetested it well sort of I drive a car with a very hard suspension mazdaspeed and I drove it on an extremely rough road for a full hour At first it began sagging a bit but then I tightened it some more and it stopped completely Normally I hate suction cups they are always crappy and fall off very easily after a while but this one has impressed me Awesome product so far has already exceeded my expectations Especially since my dash is not completely flat and it still manages to stick on holding a heavy phone on a super bumpy road in a car with a rough ride:1
I was concerned with the size of the iPhone plus I wanted a sturdy holder for my car This is my first review for Amazon because Im loving the iOttie I put it on my windshield with ease Placing the phone in and out is an easy no hassle one touch zip zap zooie It rotates telescopes up down no problem Recently went on a road trip works perfectly for my needs Highly recommend this product:1
I purchased this updated version because my old iottie didnt fit my new larger phone note  I had the old one for nearly  years and have been very satisfied with it This updated version fits my large phone but barely The phone doesnt fall off while driving so Im happy with it so far:1
Stuck on my dashboard well and is easy to use just like the old one but so much better Thanks again Will continue to purchase iottie:1
Best mobile phone holder I have ever owned I purchased this for use with a Google Pixel  XL which is in one of Googles live cases I thought I would need to be fiddling with adjustments to get a proper fit but the fit straight from the box is more than acceptable It can be easily finetuned as well for your exact needs The pressure from the arms isnt enough to trigger the squeeze sensor in the phone set to default sensitivity which was an issue with other holders The installation is a breeze I didnt need the adhesive circle at all just using the suction built onto the arm Very easily rotates from portrait to landscape but is rock solid after adjustments Highly recommended:1
Im one of those people who tends to put my phone on silent at work and throw my phone in my bag at the end of the day never having turned it back up I then miss calls or realize I need to make one and have to pull over to go digging Or I go Oh sh wheres my phone and panic thinking I left it somewhere By making it routine to put my phone here the second I get in my car I dont have to worry about where I left it or miss calls because its handy in the corner of my eye Its also great for those who use their navigation a lot you can place it just like an old GPS It was super easy to installeven for those of not very savvy and adjusts to a variety of heights I honestly want to buy one for everyone in my family now:1
My favorite new toy this iOttie Easy One is the single best accessory I have bought for my phone ever This phone mount grabs hold of your phone and keeps hold of it The printloaded catch trips with just the right amount of pressure and more than once it has caught my phone when the car hit a bump and I lost hold of the phone while trying to miount it I love this device which can be articulated swiveled spun around And maneuvered in every which way to give you the best view regardless of the shape of your dash:1
I purchased this so I can mount it on my windshield it works EXACTLY how I want it to It is easy to use and I really like the opening at the bottom to allow for a charging cable I would buy this again if I needed another one:1
Highly recommend  I have an older model iOttie car mount without the extendable arm that Ive used for years and it has served me well Recently:1
I purchased a car mount simular to this newer model but by a different maker Ive since come to appreciate just how durable and userfriendly iOttie is by comparison:1
Like my first this iOttie mount has a well designed trigger grasp and easy release function that operate effortlessly The durable construction stands the test of time:1
That is I dont have to struggle with it and it hasnt fallen apart both good by anyones standards:1
I have had this product for four months now so I figured it has been enough time to provide a decent review This phone holder far exceeded my expectations The installation was extremely simple and I was pleasantly surprised at just how securely the phone fit into the holder and does not shake or come loose at all I installed it back in December of  and it is now April of  and the suction has not come loose Not even once the holder has stayed in place the whole time even though I figured the winter coldness might affect it We will see how the summer heat may or may not affect it but judging by my experience so far I am optimistic I would definitely recommend this product:1
I purchased this later model because of the versatility it offered over the older ones Im very happy with my purchase and the suctionsticky pad works very well Mine came with an additional disk that had M tape on the bottom which may be needed for certain materials but I had a smooth plastic area available so I havent had to use the extra piece Ive removed it once to make sure there were no issues with discoloration or anything and it showed no signs of trouble:1
The suction cup is not your traditional rubber It is STICKY I can see why you should not directly stick to the river dash board However I have it for the windshield and these are it The one touch work great Simple clean solid Highly recommended for windshield use only:1
This is only my second purchase of a DashWindow mount for a smartphone I researched a lot of these in stores and on Amazon My first one was from Target and the spring loaded grip broke within a week That was a different brand Good thing it was only about  I ended up picking this one from all the choices on Amazon and boy was it the right decision I am using the suction mount on my windshield and its amazing It stuck the first time and I havent had to mess with it since It has stayed on there The suction cup plastic is definitely high grade I applied in cold weather and that didnt seem to matter I love the many adjustments you can make so its custom tailored for your viewing angle I have mine in the corner by the pillar to the left of the steering wheel I use it to to and from work and use the Waze traffic app on my phone to monitor the busy traffic in my area Its really nice I also must mention the spring loaded grip and release levers are durable and work great I dont see these breaking like the last one I highly recommend it:1
Its doing its job perfectly and no problems with installation The dash pad included with this is actually of good quality:1
Edit I should note that I did have the iOttie easy one touch  I wasnt all too happy with the product and customer service did reach out to me but I had already thrown the matter to the back of my mind This version is definitely much better and Im glad with its improvements:1
I absolutely love the iOttie dash mount series I had one of the original designs for  years and withstood heavy use and travel as I switched it between my personal vehicle and rentals without ever losing its stickadherence When it did break it was due to accumulated stress on the expandable arms over the years which is entirely understandable I upgraded to this version and have had it for a few weeks and love it even more Much more stylish and secure less car shake I highly recommend it You will not regret it:1
I use this every time I get in my car because I like to know what time Im going to arrive even if its a trip I take daily I use Waze so I ry to avoid heavy traffic during commute times I love how quickly it snaps your phone into place and how it can be oriented to landscape or portrait I had the older version and this upgrade seems a bit sturdier especially when the arm length is extended It sticks very securely to my dash board which has a very slight curve to it I definitely recommend this dashboard mount as you can very quickly snap in or snap out your phone:1
iOttie Touch  is great Does a great job securely holding and supporting my Pixel  XL and my daughters iPhone  Plus It replaces my Touch  Highly recommend Received the items within  days:1
After using it for months I love this That extension arm is awesome It stays in place extremely well and very easy to take your phone in and out of I use it for my iPhone  in an Otterbox defender really bulky case and it works with all our other phones in the family too My only minor complaint is that the ball grip tilt sometimes slips and tilts a little downward and doesn’t hold when I tighten it as strongly as I’d like it to but that is easily corrected by just by tilting the phone up with my hand while the phone is in it and it will stay in place for the rest of my drive:1
I love this dashboard holder for my new IPhone  Plus Now I can see my mapping app while I am driving It has a little vibration but I dont see how they can fix that since the roads are a little bumpy anyway:1
I love this So easy to install Super strong It was supposed to take days to get here but I sent the seller a message and asked if it could get to me by Saturday morning as I was leaving on a road trip He never responded however it arrived hours before my trip Thanks so much it made gps and nd communicating with family so much easier:1
Excellent sturdy mount I have note  and it holds very well even with going over really bad potholesbumps Their customer service is top notch as well First mount came scratched up and got replacement within few days:1
so far I really love it for the past month I have been using it seems to be withstanding the hot climate:1
Great usability Definitely works as advertised It is a little more on the higher cost compared to others on the market but worth it The flexibility and ability to control the position and orientation of the phone and where it is located in the car is a key element to it It clips the phone in very well and stays put Its also fairly easy to mount and unmount the phone with one hand The suction cup works great with the adhesive dashboard pad and supports larger sized phones without falling Have not used it on the windowshield or moved it from its position since initially installing it so cant say as much on its versatility Ive only used it for a couple of weeks so I cant say how long it will last But so far so good:1
Awesome holder and great improvements from the previous ones Ive owned:1
After having this for about  months through winter mind you the sun seems to have melted off the base I use it maybe  times a month and do not have my phone it in when not in use In winter while the sun is not shining its brightest this melted off I now cannot return this which is frustrating DO NOT BUY if you are going to place this on your dashboard as it will melt off when exposed to sun for apparently  months Totally bummed:-1
I bought this in March  It worked well for about a month or two but then the suction cup started coming off more frequently I followed the instructions and rinsed it with some warm water then let it air dry This helped for a little while but then it would keep falling off as the weather got warmer Once summer rolled around there was no point in even attempting to stick it back into place Eventually even the pad came unglued from my dashboard because of the heat The holder itself seemed to be well made but it’s just a shame it wouldn’t stay mounted:-1
I bought this item because the description stated it would stick to my dash It did not The product came with a permanent adhesive patch that needed to be stuck to the dash I followed the directions precisely even taking the extra step to carefully clean and dry my dash before attaching the adhesive patch I gave it  minutes to cure but the minute I attached the suction cup and unit it all came tumbling off After that it was useless Product returned for refund:-1
I cleaned my dashboard and attempted to install it The sticky dash pad held for about a day and then the next time I got in my car the whole thing had fallen off dash pad and all To their credit iOttie sent me a complete replacement This time I made sure to wait until it was  degrees outside  degrees warmer than what they recommend On the new one the dash pad stuck well but the suction cup won’t hold to the dash pad at all yes I flipped the lever down I didn’t even get a chance to put my phone in it this time  the unit falls even under its own weight I’m super disappointed because I really like all the angles of adjustment available and when I hold the unit in my hand my phone is held very securely:-1
The iOttie refused to stick on to the dashboard After trying a million times i just gave up:-1
I’m surprised by ilottie I have a Jeep Liberty n the black pad they recommend you use for the dash board was not compatible The weight of the iPhone s was too much for the black dashboard pad kept coming off after a few seconds Disappointing:-1
if you are using a protective case for phone this device will not work sending mine back:-1
I owned an original iottie and had it for over four years It worked great I purchased the iottie  and attached it to the provided mounting disc to my dash It fell off over night under its own weight I tried again with the phone and it failed within seconds Not sure what changed Obviously something with the suction cup material Ive contacted the company but waiting on a response:-1
Would not stick to dashboard:-1
To start it was working really well Held my Moto Z Play with no shaking It was very difficult to remove to place in a different area Then it happened I parked one day that had sun for more than  hours the suction gum melted Now its rendered useless:-1
I have a  Honda CRV and the windshield is set too far back to be easy to use the iOttie and I do not want it on my dash Sorry I ordered and have to pay  shipping to return this item Buying online is not necessarily the thing to do for all purchases:-1
Used the dashmount disk On a slight extend curve The mount held for a few days then let go on the next hot day Rinsed the gel pad in warm water as directed Will not hold for even minutes:-1
I tried the suction cup on my windshield It lasted  minutes before it fell off Tried the adhesive pad next Same result Just didnt feel like the mount could support the weight:-1
Absolute piece of junk The base doesnt stick to the dashboard so it just keeps falling off Waste of money:-1
Caution as the stickypad ruined the dashboard of my Porsche Boxster It removed dash material leaving a partial light ring on the centre of my dash This will be very costly to repair The pads sticky part was then useless after that one use so I cant even use it to cover the damage while I figure out what to do Note that I bought this as an upgrade from Version  as I loved that one and had no issues with it:-1
I purchased this back in December  and the center clip has already come apart I am  for  meaning I’ve purchased  and this is the second one which has come apart I think that I’m done with iOttie:-1
I liked the item when the weather was cold but when it turned warm in Ohio in May the item would not stay on the dashboard it fell off constantly The holder would no longer stick to my dashboard It is too late to return the item since my purchase so i am stuck with a phone holder that does not work I had no idea it would fail in the heat until warm weather came Very disappointed:-1
Suction doesnt stay to the plastic part that is supplied to be able to hook it to the dashboard The dash part will not stay attached with the tape that is supplied when it gets warm in the car:-1
I’ve had this since February and it’s constantly falling off my dashboard I never had this issue with the iOttie Touch  The mount itself is fine and sturdy but what’s the point if it isn’t even sticky enough to stay put:-1
Not worth the purchase The sticky part that sticks it to your dashboard does not stick whatsoever Literally tried placing it on there and it immediately fell off and is useless now:-1
I followed the instructions carefully and still the dashboard pad doesnt stick at all I bought this only for the ability to put it on the dashboard and now I dont know what to do with it:-1
This is the fourth iottie Ive owned and the first to disappoint The device will not stay locked so that i can push the phone into place to lock it This is surprising since my previous models worked perfectly:-1
As other have written this contraption is on again  off again Returned to Amazon:-1
I live in the New Orleans area and the sun gets hot on the dashboard Even though it is still spring here and the outside temperature is in the low s this product refused to adhere to my dashboard and my cell phone went flying several times before I just gave up This product was a waste of my money:-1
It does not stick to the car Can not support the phone weight:-1
Fell of the dash first day:-1
Special dashboard pad was installed After less than  months the suction cup doesnt stay on the pad Unit falls off even without the weight of the phone:-1
The temperature outside was about  degrees and the whole thing fell off and won’t stick anymore Disappointed:-1
Falls off my dash all the time Eventually gave up on it:-1
Does not stay up Even without phone the suction cup lets go The sticky disk lasted  mins Installed per directions on clean smooth surface Tried on window also Cleaned suction cup per instructions to try again also No good:-1
Worked for a few months But the suction is already not working well Even with the mount attached to my dashboard:-1
Followed instructions exactly as specified and the device became unattached from the windshield during the first use There appears to be too much of the gel coating it cannot simply be washed in warm water for reuse:-1
Worked fine for  weeks then fell off It’s still sticky but wont hold for more than  minutes anymore:-1
It did not stick I cleaned my dashboard before putting it on And held it in place for awhile Was hoping it would work:-1
Seriously just installed this yesterday and was very excited to put it to use Followed all instructions perfectly as well When I got in the car this morning the whole mount had fallen onto the seat The car pad did not hold up and obviously can’t stick back onto the dash Highly disappointed probably going to macgyver this dash pad now:-1
Poor suction quality and declined since iOttie one touch  I had one touch  couple years ago and it use fall off in summer times when interior heat builds up So I had to replace it This version couldn’t even stick on my dash now Waste of money and time Otherwise quality and build is great:-1
Disappointed After  weeks does not stick anymore Waste of my money:-1
Do not buy this if you live in a hot climate After a few months in Florida my mount fell off the dashboard It does not stay stuck to the sticky pad anymore:-1
I bought this a couple of months ago and it wont stay open:-1
its too bulky and wont stay still:-1
